# What is it?

This repository is both my personal GitHub page, as well as the generator code that I use to make it.

# What do I need to install it?

- [Node & npm](https://nodejs.org/en)

# How do I use it?

- Clone/fork this repo (as `your-username.github.io`)
- Edit `src/_data/config.json` with your GitHub username
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` to start the dev server
- `npm run build` to build the site for deployment

You'll need to set the `/docs` directory as the output base for your GitHub sites.

# What does the output look like?

Without any changes, it will look like this: [http://jmhobbs.github.io/](http://jmhobbs.github.io/)
